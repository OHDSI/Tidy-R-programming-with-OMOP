# Getting started with databases from R

In this first half of the book, we will explore how to work with databases from R. In the following chapters, you'll see that when working with data held in a relational database, we can leverage various open-source R packages to perform tidyverse-style data analyses.

-   In @sec-working_with_databases we will perform a simple data analysis from start to finish using a table in a database.
-   In @sec-tidyverse_verbs we will see in more detail how familiar dplyr functions can be used to combine data spread across different tables in a database into an analytic dataset for further analysis in R.
-   In @sec-tidyverse_expressions we will see how we can perform more complex data manipulation via translation of R code into SQL specific to the database management system being used.
-   In @sec-data_model we will see how we can build data pipelines by creating a data model in R to represent the relational database we're working with and creating functions and methods to work with it.
