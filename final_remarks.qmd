# Final remarks

*Tidy R programming with the OMOP CDM* aims to (1) explain the main principles for working with databases from R and (2) how to apply this principles and use it with the OMOP Common Data Model. Hopefully after reading this book you can understand how the dplyr and dbplyr packages interact with the databases, in particular with data formatted to the OMOP CDM; and how the cdm_reference object can be used to extract TODO.
