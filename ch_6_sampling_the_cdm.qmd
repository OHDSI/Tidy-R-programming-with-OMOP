# Sampling the cdm


## Subset of CDM tables
Our cdm reference will include all of the OMOP CDM tables that could be found in our database. We may though only want a subset of these tables, in which case we can explicity specify those of interest:

```{r, echo = TRUE}
# cdm_1 <- cdm_from_con(db) %>% 
#   cdm_select_tbl("person","observation_period")
# cdm_1
```

We can also select a group of tables, for example selecting only the vocabulary tables like so:
```{r, echo = TRUE}
# cdm_2 <- cdm  %>% 
#   cdm_select_tbl(tbl_group("vocab"))
# cdm
```



## Sample records in a table

## Random sample of the cdm

## Cohort-based subset of the cdm
